        <h1>Japan</h1>

        <p>
            This country called Japan... is simple majestic. This is just an understatement. One of my goals in my life was to travel to this country. I do not remember a time in my thirty years of life on this bluish-green object called Earth that I was not totally enthusiastic about Japan. I was given the opportunity to be stationed in Japan thanks to the US Navy. I was able to actually experience the marvel of this country that I had only seen on the television screen or in an book. This famous and remarkable place has undoubtedly influenced my in fundamental ways. I am thankful that I was able to check off this tasks on my bucket list. I consider this place my "second" home or rather an escape from the mundane life of being an American. Let me state that America is great and holds it's own charm but this page is not about America. I'm only going to provide a minute glimpse of this incredible place named J.A.P.A.N.!
