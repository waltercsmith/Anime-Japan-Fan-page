        <h1>Japan</h1>

        <p>
            This country called Japan... is simple majestic. This is just an understatement. One of my goals in my life was to travel to this country. I do not remember a time in my thirty years of life on this bluish-green object called Earth that I was not totally enthusiastic about Japan. I was given the opportunity to be stationed in Japan thanks to the US Navy. I was able to actually experience the marvel of this country that I had only seen on the television screen or in an book. This famous and remarkable place has undoubtedly influenced my in fundamental ways. I am thankful that I was able to check off this tasks on my bucket list. I consider this place my "second" home or rather an escape from the mundane life of being an American. Let me state that America is great and holds it's own charm but this page is not about America. I'm only going to provide a minute glimpse of this incredible place named J.A.P.A.N.! So delve into this place a little bit shall we!

        <h2>A Brief Synopsis of Japan's History</h2>

        <p>
            This place is an island country but actually consists of a collection of islands (four large islands and several smaller ones). Active and dormant volcanoes are located in abundance and I had the honor of trekking up one... yes, that's right Mt. Fuji!! Yeah, I'm an adventurer at my core which only videogames and media only strengthen this notion. Japan contains a unique balance of upholding ancient traditions as well as a forerunner of technology and modernism. An example of this would be traveling to Kamakura to view the Great Buddha and a few block from this site is an heavy urbanized city with many technological commodities such as toilets that make sounds when you have a bout of flatulence. Population of Japan had an opportunity to develop their own unique identity due being isolated from larger landmasses such as China. The national language is Japanese but it's linguistic history vast and the rise of the Japanese language that is present today underwent a incredible transformation. I would go into greater detail but I think most would be interested the cuisine, specific places, activities, and unique products of Japan. I like food so let us begin with... some of my favorites or go-tos!
