        <h1>Japan</h1>

        <p>
            This country called Japan... is simple majestic. This is just an understatement. One of my goals in my life was to travel to this country. I do not remember a time in my thirty years of life on this bluish-green object called Earth that I was not totally enthusiastic about Japan. I was given the opportunity to be stationed in Japan thanks to the US Navy. I was able to actually experience the marvel of this country that I had only seen on the television screen or in an book. This famous and remarkable place has undoubtedly influenced my in fundamental ways. I am thankful that I was able to check off this tasks on my bucket list. I consider this place my "second" home or rather an escape from the mundane life of being an American. Let me state that America is great and holds it's own charm but this page is not about America. I'm only going to provide a minute glimpse of this incredible place named J.A.P.A.N.! So delve into this place a little bit shall we!

        <h2>A Brief Synopsis of Japan's History</h2>

        <p>
            This place is an island country but actually consists of a collection of islands (four large islands and                several smaller ones). Active and dormant volcanoes are located in abundance and I had the honor of trekking            up one... yes, that's right Mt. Fuji!! Yeah, I'm an adventurer at my core which only videogames and media               only strengthen this notion. Japan contains a unique balance of upholding ancient traditions as well as a               forerunner of technology and modernism. An example of this would be traveling to Kamakura to view the Great Buddha and a few block from this site is an heavy urbanized city with many technological commodities such as toilets that make sounds when you have a bout of flatulence. Population of Japan had an opportunity to develop their own unique identity due being isolated from larger landmasses such as China. The national language is Japanese but it's linguistic history vast and the rise of the Japanese language that is present today underwent a incredible transformation. I would go into greater detail but I think most would be interested the cuisine, specific places, activities, and unique products of Japan. I like food so let us begin with... some of my favorites or go-tos!

                    <p>
                        This excellent dish is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C5%ABdon">Gy큰don </a> beef                      bowl.<br> The main telling ingredients are: rice, simmered beef & onions.<br> This is the bare minimum                  requirements for this dish.<br> My favorite spot to consume in this dish is called <a href="https://en                      .wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiya_(restaurant_chain)">Sukiya!</a>

                        This may very well be the staple... the crown jewel of cuisine in Japan. I give you...<a href="https://en               .wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen">Ramen!</a><br> I'm just going to keep with the motif of over-simplifying                     great cuisine.<br> This is usually wheat noodles, a broth, some type of meat.<br> But there is so much                  more to this incredible dish. Like gy큰don, ramen are simply terrific!

                    <p>
                        I was stationed in Japan for roughly three years but I would only actually reside their about six months out of the year max.<br>
                        I personally would love to return and engage in several activities that I did not experience.<br>
                        One such activity I completed was trek up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji">Mount Fuji!</a><br>

                        The view was breath-taking and definitely a life-changing experience!

                    <h3>Anime</h3>

                    <p>
                        This a unique style of animation whether it's drawn by hand or through computer animation. This art form originated in Japan. As fan of various style of art I must say that anime is one aspect of Japan that many people globally recognize. Typically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a> is adaptation of manga which are Japanese comics. These are fictional anime/manga characters that I'm a fan of personally.
