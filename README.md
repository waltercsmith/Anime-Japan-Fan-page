# Anime-Japan-Fan-page
A web page detailing a particular fictional character and the country of Japan
The anime character I'm going to use is name Guts or Gatsu depending if the dubbing is English or Japanese
I'm going to discuss some cuisine, locations, and popular activities that I enjoyed during my time in Japan
I intend to use some jQuery to alter the document and some bootstrap as well as custom CSS
There's some basic functions that will be console logged
And there will be at least one alert and probably a prompt
